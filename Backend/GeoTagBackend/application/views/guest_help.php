									<h5><strong>User Manual</strong></h5>
									
									<br>
									<p>As a <strong>guest</strong> you can explore map and destinations added by registered user as you wish.</p>
									<p>
										Once you register you become a regular <strong>user</strong>, yey! This means: you gain possibility to add your personal reviews of destinations you've enjoyed and up or downvote other reviews.
										As part of your review images might be added.
										Your reviews will be seen by others users and guests, so write them carefully!
									</p>
									<p>
										After many,many upvotes on your reviews you might become <strong>super user</strong>!
										This unlocks option to add new destinations and delete bad/offensive review.
										Being a super user is great responsibility!
									</p>
									<p>
										Of course, there will always be some <strong>admin</strong> out there waiting for bad/offensive review or maybe approving your new destination.
